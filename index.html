        <h2>Espresso</h2>
        <p>
          The Espresso was invented by a brilliant Milanese inventor by the name
          of Luigi Bezzera, who coupled his passion for steam with a love of
          coffee and came up with the brilliant yet simple idea of making coffee
          with steam pressure. This revolutionized the concept of making coffee
          with a pot of boiling water. The espresso acts as a base for many
          coffee drinks, including lattes, mochas, americanos, and espresso
          romanos.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make an espresso shot, simply boil water and add to a French Press,
          Moka Pot, or Aeropress. Grind your coffee beans finely and press into
          the machine with boiling water until espresso is extracted for the
          highest amount of caffeine. Or, there is always the option of instant
          espresso powder.

        <h2>Latte</h2>
        <p>
          A latte, also known as a cafe latte, is a coffee drink with espresso,
          steamed milk and a layer of foam on top. The term comes from the
          Italian caffellatte, which literally means "coffee and milk." The
          French term café au lait was used in cafés in several countries in
          western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French
          themselves started using the term café crème for coffee with milk or
          cream.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the drink, first make espresso coffee (see previous slide),
          and add your choice of milk. The espresso and milk should be a 1:3
          ratio. To top of all off, use a milk frother to whisk warm milk to add
          it to the top of the drink.

        <h2>Mocha</h2>
        <p>
          In the early days of coffee’s globalization, Yemen benefitted from a
          monopoly on the world’s coffee bean production: The Moka bean. In its
          originating term, “mocha” referred to beans imported from Al Moka — a
          Yemeni port city that once reigned as a supreme center for trade and
          commerce during Yemen’s coffee hold in the 17th century. Moka beans
          consisted of a variety of Arabica coffee beans harvested in
          neighboring mountain regions in central Yemen — notably not in Al
          Moka. After they were harvested, the beans would be roasted and
          shipped to the port. The mocha beverage we’re familiar with appears to
          be a product of Italian influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make a mocha latte, combine 2 ounces of espreso with 1 cup of milk
          and 1-2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup. mix well and top it off with
          whipped cream and any choice of toppings. Enjoy!

        <h2>Americano</h2>
        <p>
          During World War II, US servicemen were drinking so much coffee that
          Army Quartermaster Corps had to to grind, package and ship coffee
          overseas just so the military would have enough to go around. Soldiers
          were used to the drip coffee they would drink at home, so when they
          encountered coffee made in a different way, it was sometimes
          unenjoyable and too bitter for them. This is where the Americano was
          born. Adding water to the espresso the soldiers came across in Italy
          was the easiest way they found to make the coffee feel more like home.
          The Americano soon became an increasingly popular drink both across
          Europe and in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Americano is simple yet powerful. To make the drink, add a single
          or double espresso shot to 2/3 cups of hot water. Enjoy it with sugar,
          cream, ice cubes, or any other coffee additions.

        <h2>Espresso Romano</h2>
        <p>
          According to experts, the espresso romano specialty was invented
          somewhere in the United States, but has been said to have orginated in
          Rome. Nevertheless, the drink is listed in cafés all over Italy,
          especially around Naples and Rome. The espresso romano combines
          espresso with the sweet and citrusy flavors of lemon. The lemon adds a
          tangy acidity to the bitter coffee, which is perfect for the summer
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make an espresso romano, simply combine one or two shots of
          espresso with a squeeze of lemon juice and a teaspoon of sugar. It’s a
          versatile drink that can be served hot, cold, or iced – and with or
          without milk.
